## Overview

Welcome to our Baseball Analysis project! Our goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms to assist MLB teams in strategic planning, especially in light of the 2023 Rule changes. We're dedicated to providing stakeholders with data-driven insights for making informed decisions about the future.

We've focused on three fundamental aspects of team building:

1. **Predicting Player WAR:** We employ machine learning to predict which players under 30 are likely to experience the most significant increases in Wins Above Replacement (WAR) in 2023. This predictive model serves as a valuable resource for future years.

2. **Pitching Performance Analysis:** We've examined pitching performance leading up to 2023, constructing a model to predict performance changes in 2023. Our model identifies the key features contributing to these predictions.

3. **Hitting Performance Analysis:** Similar to our pitching analysis, we've conducted an in-depth exploration of hitting performance, predicting changes for 2023.

## Dashboards and Tableau

To facilitate interaction with the pitcher and hitter data, we've designed two interactive Plotly Dash dashboards. Follow these steps to run the dashboards on your local host:

- For the **Pitcher Dashboard:** Enter the name of any starting pitcher to view average metrics from 2018-2022 (excluding 2020). The dashboard provides z-score differences for 2023 predictions, along with indications of model accuracy. You'll also find images of the top 30 pitchers for 2023 according to ESPN.

- The **Hitter Dashboard:** Functions similarly, offering insights on 256 active position players' metrics and prediction verdicts for the 2023 MLB season. It also showcases a striking background featuring Fenway Park's blueprint.

Additionally, our Tableau story dashboard delves into 2023 WAR predictions, with a focus on young players. Navigate through interactive graphs and images, and explore predicted WAR for 2023. Take a peek at the team projected to have the highest WAR for 2024 and compare it to the current standings.
