## Overview

Welcome to our Baseball Analysis project! Our goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms to assist MLB teams in strategic planning, especially in light of the 2023 Rule changes. We're dedicated to providing stakeholders with data-driven insights for making informed decisions about the future.

The Modern Era of baseball (2000s-2020s) has seen an increased emphasis on advanced statistics and analytics that has revolutionized player evaluation and strategic decision-making.

Teams have leveraged data to evaluate players more precisely, influencing strategic decisions. Pitchers excelled as teams shifted to power pitching as well as optimizing matchups with pitching changes and defensive shifts.

To combat these changes, hitters began emphasizing launch angles and power hitting, leading to fewer balls in play.

To maintain pace of play and increase excitement, this season the MLB implemented a pitch clock, limited defensive shifts, and instituted a universal DH, along with a few changes to increase base stealing attempts.

All together, these changes were expected to increase pace of play, increase balls in play, and overall, just make the game more exciting.

We've focused on three fundamental aspects of team building in this new environment:

1. **Predicting Player WAR:** We employ machine learning to predict which players under 30 are likely to experience the most significant increases in Wins Above Replacement (WAR) in 2023. This predictive model serves as a valuable resource for future years.

2. **Pitching Performance Analysis:** We've examined pitching performance leading up to 2023, constructing a model to predict performance changes in 2023. Our model identifies the key features contributing to these predictions.

3. **Hitting Performance Analysis:** Similar to our pitching analysis, we've conducted an in-depth exploration of hitting performance, predicting changes for 2023.

## Dashboards and Tableau

To facilitate interaction with the pitcher and hitter data, we've designed two interactive Plotly Dash dashboards. Follow these steps to run the dashboards on your local host:

- For the **Pitcher Dashboard:** Enter the name of any starting pitcher to view average metrics from 2018-2022 (excluding 2020). The dashboard provides z-score differences for 2023 predictions, along with indications of model accuracy. You'll also find images of the top 30 pitchers for 2023 according to ESPN.

- The **Hitter Dashboard:** Functions similarly, offering insights on 256 active position players' metrics and prediction verdicts for the 2023 MLB season. It also showcases a striking background featuring Fenway Park's blueprint.

To utilize the dashboards, you will need to download the Dash-Pitcher and Dash-Hitter. Once downloaded, you will need to open gitbash or terminal at the directory. 

For the picher dashboard use this command:
    
    python pitch_app.py 

For the hitter dashboard:
    
    python hit_app.py
    
The flask app should run on localhost http://127.0.0.1:8050/ or http://127.0.0.1:8051/.

Additionally, our [Tableau story dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leonardo.pierantoni/viz/MLBPredictions/Story1?publish=yes) delves into 2023 WAR predictions, with a focus on young players. Navigate through interactive graphs and images, and explore predicted WAR for 2023. Take a peek at the team projected to have the highest WAR for 2024 and compare it to the current standings.
