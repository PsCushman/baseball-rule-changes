## Abstract

Our project attempts to present machine learning alogrythms that could be used to help MLB team plan for the future. With Rule changes taking effect this year, we wanted to present stakeholders with information to make personal decisions into the future. 

We took on three essential areas of any team building exersise.

First, we looked to machine learning to perdict which players under 30 were projected to have the most signigant WAR (Wins Above Replacement) increases in 2023 so that the model could be used in future years.

Second, we looked at pitching performace before 2023 to construct a model that could predict an increase or decline in proframce in 2023 and exactly which features were being used by the model to make those predictions.

Lastly, and similarlly, we did a similar thing with hitting performance. 

## Dashboards and Tableau

For the pitcher and hitter data, we made interactive Plotly Dash dashboards. To run this dashboards, simply download the files and run them on a local host.

For the pitcher dashboard, simply type in the name of any starting pitcher and it will return avergaes of selected metrics from 2018-2022 (excluding 2020) and also the z-score difference for 2023. It will also return a indication of whether our model got that perdiction right. It also, inclues pictures from the top 30 pitchers for 2023 according to ESPN.

The hitter dashboard is set up pretty much the same way but includes a stunning background of Fenway Park's blueprint. Type in a name and check out the metrics and prediction verdicts for 256 active position players in the MLB for 2023. In addition, use it as a starting point to navigate to our analysize.

The tableau stroy dashboard explores WAR predictions for 2023 with a look to the futre as it focuses on young players. Toggle through interactive graphs and images as well as take a look at the
